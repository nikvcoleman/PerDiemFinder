# PerDiemFinder
Python3.7 script for getting Per Diem rates based on gsa.gov 

PER_DIEM_FINDER.py is the original source code and can be run with python3.
I originally wrote this for my employer but feel free to use and distribute this code.
I have plans in the near future to add an .exe version that can be run on windows 10 for users who are not very "tech savy"
there may even be an android version in the works at some distant time in the future...but for now this is it.
