# PerDiemFinder
# BRANCH: PERDY_OVERSEAS(TEST)

Python3.7 script for getting Per Diem rates based on gsa.gov 

PER_DIEM_FINDER.py is the original  python source code and can be run with python3.
I have added an .exe file that can be run on Windows 10 for users who are not very "tech savy".
There may even be an android version in the works at some distant time in the future...but for now this is it.
 
To use the windows version :
Simply download zip file...
Unzip it to desired location...
And click the exe file...
That should be it.

NOTE: This Branch is for developing option 2 of 'PERDY' and adding overseas functionality to the code.
