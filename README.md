# PerDiemFinder
Python3.7 script for getting Per Diem rates based on gsa.gov 

PER_DIEM_FINDER.py is the original  python source code and can be run with python3.
I have added an .exe file that can be run on Windows 10 for users who are not very "tech savy".
There may even be an android version in the works at some distant time in the future...but for now this is it.
 
To use the windows version :
simply download zip file
Unzip it to desired location
And click the exe file.
That should be it.

NOTE: I AM STILL DEVELOPING THE OVERSEAS PERDIEM PART OF THE PROGRAM.
