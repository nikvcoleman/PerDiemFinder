# PerDiemFinder
# BRANCH: PERDY_GUI(TEST)

Python3.7 script for getting Per Diem rates based on gsa.gov 

PER_DIEM_FINDER.py is the original  python source code and can be run with python3.
I have added an .exe file that can be run on Windows 10 for users who are not very "tech savy".
There may even be an android version in the works at some distant time in the future...but for now this is it.

NOTE: This branch is for development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the python module: 'Tkinter'
the file containing the GUI is called perdygui.py and is standalone from the rest of the files
